"""The Microcosm build a model run uses, and the engine it was built on.

The rule (12 November 2026): use the newest published Microcosm build with
the policyengine-uk version it was built and certified on, even when no
policyengine.py release covers that pair, and never mix a build with
another engine version. ``DATA_BUILD`` is the one place that names the
build; the engine pins in ``pyproject.toml`` must match its ``engine`` and
``core`` (tests/test_runtime_identity.py checks them).
